Blooprint.xyz is a hand drawing input platform enabling the mechanics to a living documentation system through handwriting.

If a hand drawing was placed in front of an audience and the only thing that had to be done was the group of people looking at it had to argue about it, you'd eventually get to a refined explanation, perhaps even an exact transcription of what was written.  Blooprint.xyz is a handwriting input system and is a platform enabling documentation and distribution of hand-drawn work.

Now, imagine changing the drawing and taking credit for that change.
