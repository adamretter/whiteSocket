Blooprint.xyz is a hand drawing input platform enabling the mechanics to a living documentation system through handwriting.

If a hand drawing was placed in front of an audience and the only thing that had to be done was the group of people looking at it had to argue about it, you'd eventually get to a refined explanation, perhaps even an exact transcription of what was written.

Now, imagine changing the drawing and taking credit for its use.
