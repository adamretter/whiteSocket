If a picture is placed in front of an audience and the only thing that had to be done was the group of people looking at it had to argue about it, you'd eventually get to a refined explanation, perhaps even an exact transcription of what was drawn by hand.  This is the measurement system that gives credibility to hand-drawn/written work.  Imagine design and education applications.
